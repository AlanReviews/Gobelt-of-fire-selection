I am creating an algorithm to select 3 candidates from the Goblet of Fire. Each candidate has an name, age, and school. Every candidate must be at at least 17 years of age in order to participate in the Triwizard tournament.

This program is not affiliated with JK Rowling and the Harry Potter series. It is created by a fan.

### Lore
Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang compete for the Triwizard Cup. In order to compete for the Triwizard Cup, each school needs an older student to represent their school.

### Steps
1. Students put their names in the Goblet of Fire for the Triwizard Tournament. All students must be 17 years or older.
Any underage student will not be allowed to partcipate in the Triwizard Tournament. If a student is underage, the program goes back to the menu. If there is no input, the program goes back to the main menu.
2. The Goblet of fire will choose 3 students from different schools to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. I programmed my Goblet of fire to choose 3 random students from diffeerent schools.
3. Print out the chosen candidates.

### Compilation
1. Download this file and unzip it
2. Call make
3. Call ./executable and enjoy

#### Compilation Notes
Tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 enviroment. The code works with C++98 and C++11 syntax.
