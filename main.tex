\maketitle

\par
First of all, assume the Goblet of Fire picks student names randomly. \newline
Let B represent the number of Beauxbatons students who placed their name in the Goblet of Fire. \newline
Let D represent the number of Durmstrang students who placed their name in the Goblet of Fire. \newline
Let H represent the number of Hogwarts students who placed their name in the Goblet of Fire. \newline
\newline
\mbox{The probability for a selection in any order is: }
$$\frac{1}{B} \times \frac{1}{D} \times \frac{1}{H}$$

The probability of finding picking a specific student is
$$\frac{1}{D + B + H}$$
\newline
The minimum is
\( \frac{1}{3} \)

Note that there must be at least 1 Beauxbatons student, 1 Durmstrang student, and 1 Hogwarts student who entered their name in the Goblet of Fire. As a result,
$$\frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}$$
